# ESP32 Arcade Remote Control

## Overview

This is a micropython project for a 3d printed control box with 7 arcade push buttons that control various smart devices (mostly Shelly relays) like lights and doors. Each pushbutton has an LED inside that can be controlled separately via shift register. LED lights are turned on or off based on MQTT status update from controlled devices.
